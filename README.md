## Rustix

Rustix is a Rust project template that uses [Actix-web][1] for API services. I'm using this to learn Rust and Actix-web at the same time for building API services.

If you chance upon this project and have some views on how I can improve the overall project structure, please let me know.

### Key Features

- [Actix-web][1]: 4.0.0 Beta 15
- [sqlx][2] for DB + Migrations, defaults to Postgresql drivers
- [rstest][3] for test fixtures
